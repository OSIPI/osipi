# About

osipi is developed by the **Open Source Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI)**, an initiative of the perfusion study group of the **International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM)**.

The osipi package structure and logic follow the lexicon defined by OSIPI, and wrap around selected implementations collected in the code contributions of OSIPI.

## Scope

osipi currently only includes methods for the dynamic contrast (DC) approach to perfusion MRI (DC-MRI, a unifying term for the separate fields DCE-MRI and DSC-MRI). In particular, arterial spin labelling (ASL) solutions are not currently included, but this may change in the future.

!!! note "Future Updates"
    The inclusion of arterial spin labelling (ASL) solutions may change in the future.
