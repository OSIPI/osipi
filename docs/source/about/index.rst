About
#####

``osipi`` is developed by the Open Source Initiative for Perfusion Imaging `OSIPI <https://osipi.github.io/>`_, an initiative of the perfusion study group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine `ISMRM <https://www.ismrm.org>`_.

The ``osipi`` package structure and logic follows the `lexicon <https://osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/>`_ defined by OSIPI, and wraps around selected implementations collected in the `code contributions <https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection>`_ of OSIPI.

Scope
^^^^^

`osipi` currently only includes methods for the dynamic contrast (DC) approach to perfusion MRI (DC-MRI, a unifying term for the separate fields DCE-MRI and DSC-MRI). In particular arterial spin labelling (ASL) solutions are not currently included, but this may change in the future.
