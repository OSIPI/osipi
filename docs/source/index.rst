``osipi`` is developed by the Open Source Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI), an initiative of the perfusion study group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM).

The ``osipi`` package structure and logic follows the lexicon defined by OSIPI, and wraps around selected implementations collected in the original code contributions of OSIPI.
