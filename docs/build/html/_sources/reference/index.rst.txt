This reference manual details all functions included in ``osipi``, describing what they are and what they do. Documentation of individual functions contains self-contained example code that demonstrates basic usage of the function. 

The ``osipi`` package currently only includes methods for the dynamic contrast (DC) approach to perfusion MRI (DC-MRI, a unifying term for the separate fields DCE-MRI and DSC-MRI). In particular arterial spin labelling (ASL) solutions are not currently included, but may be added in the future.

This reference guide, like the ``osipi`` package itself, adheres closely to the structure and language of the `OSIPI Lexicon <https://osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/>`_.


.. warning::

    ``osipi`` is in development and this reference guide currently contains mainly empty placeholder entries.
